# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements cross-device data persistence for the audiobook library app that works with GitHub Pages static hosting. The solution will use GitHub Gist as a simple cloud database, allowing users to access their audiobook collection from any device by providing a personal access token.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my audiobook collection to sync across all my devices, so that I can access the same library from my Mac, phone, and tablet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user provides a GitHub personal access token THEN the system SHALL create or connect to a private GitHub Gist for data storage
2. WHEN the user adds a new audiobook THEN the system SHALL automatically save the collection to the GitHub Gist
3. WHEN the user edits an existing audiobook THEN the system SHALL update the GitHub Gist with the changes
4. WHEN the user opens the app on any device with the same token THEN the system SHALL load the collection from the GitHub Gist
5. WHEN the user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL sync with the latest data from the GitHub Gist

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my audiobook data, so that I can backup my collection or transfer it to another device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Export Data" THEN the system SHALL generate a downloadable JSON file containing all audiobook data
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include all audiobook fields, categories, and metadata
3. WHEN the export completes THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback that the download is ready
4. WHEN the user wants to export THEN the system SHALL format the data in a human-readable JSON structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to import audiobook data from a file, so that I can restore my collection or add books from another source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Import Data" THEN the system SHALL display a file selection dialog
2. WHEN the user selects a valid JSON file THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the audiobook data
3. WHEN importing data THEN the system SHALL merge new books with existing collection without creating duplicates
4. WHEN import validation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and not corrupt existing data
5. WHEN import succeeds THEN the system SHALL update LocalStorage and refresh the gallery display

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle connection and authentication issues gracefully, so that I can still use the app even when there are sync problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GitHub token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and prompt for a new token
2. WHEN there's no internet connection THEN the system SHALL use cached data and show an offline indicator
3. WHEN GitHub API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to LocalStorage and attempt to sync when connection is restored
4. WHEN sync conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide options to resolve conflicts (keep local, keep remote, or merge)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set up sync easily with clear instructions, so that I can get cross-device access without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first visits the app THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for creating a GitHub personal access token
2. WHEN the user enters a token THEN the system SHALL validate it and provide feedback on success or failure
3. WHEN setup is complete THEN the system SHALL store the token securely and begin syncing automatically
4. WHEN the user wants to change tokens THEN the system SHALL provide an easy way to update the authentication

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to clear my data when needed, so that I can start fresh or troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Clear All Data" THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation with a clear warning
2. WHEN the user confirms data clearing THEN the system SHALL remove all audiobook data from both GitHub Gist and local cache
3. WHEN data is cleared THEN the system SHALL reset to the initial state with sample data or empty collection
4. WHEN clearing data THEN the system SHALL provide feedback that the operation completed successfully
